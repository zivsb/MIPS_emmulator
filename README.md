# MIPS emulator

## Project overview

This project develops a MIPS emulator in C++, by Peiyang Song and Ziv Weissman (names sorted by alphabet instead of evaluation of contribution). This is the authors' final project for the W23 CMPTGCS 1B (Computer Organization and Logic Design) class co-taught by Dr. Jonathan Balkind and Dr. Ziad Matni (names sorted, again, by alphabet), and the authors would like to thank the professors for their invaluable advice and amazing lectures.

## Live demo

In this section, we begin our introduction with a live demo. In the video, we first create a test file to show how our MIPS emulator successfully handle several core functions and instructions in MIPS (including loop, if-else branching, input and output, basic calculations, etc.). Then we move on to discuss how we have employed an exception handling mechanism to address possible invalid inputs.
